# What is a Network

A computer Netowrk is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes.
- Data Transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cables, Wireless, microwave transmissions or fre-space optical communication.
- Sneakernet is an informal term for the transfer of electronic information by physically moving media. (USBs, diskets, etc)

# What is a Server

A server is a computer program or a device that provide a functionality for other devices called "Clients".
- A Client is a piece of cumputer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.

# What is a NIC

NIC stands for Network Interface Controller (Card), a network adapter component that connect devices to the network.

***

# What is MAC Address

MAC stands for Media Access Control Address, is unique identifier assigned to a NIC, for use as network addressw in communications within the network segment.
- MAC recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)
- Each Address includes the Manufacturer's unique Identifier (OUI)

***

# What is Modulation

Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted.
-A modulator is a device that performs modulation. A demodulator is a device that performs demodulation
- A Modem can perform both operations.

***

# What is a Bus Network

A Bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus.
- A host on a bus network is called a station.
- A bus network forms a single network segment and collision domain.
- In order for nodes to share the bus, they use a medium access control technology such as carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) or a bus master.

***

# What is DHCP

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is a network management protocol used to assign IP Address nd other parameters to each device on the network.
- In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address.

***

# What is a Repeater

A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it.
- Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances.

***

# What is a Hub

Hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment.
- It has multiple I/O ports, signal sent over every port except the original incoming.
- Hub works at later 1.

***

# What is switch

Network Switch is networking hardware that connects devices to network using frame switching to receive and forward data.
- Uses MAC Addresses to forward data (Works at layer 2).

***

# What is a Router

Router is a networking device that forward data packets between devices on the network.
- Routers perform traffic directuin functions.
- Layer 3 device

***

# What is LAN

LAN stands for Local Area Network, is a type of network that interconnects computers within a limited area.

***

# What is WAN

WAN stands for Wide Area Netowk, type of network that extends over a large geographical area.

***

# What is a Firewall

Firewall is a system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- Establishes a barrier between a trusted Internal network and Untrusted External Network
- There's 2 type of Firewalls (Network firewalls or Host-based firewalls)
	- Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks and run on network hardware
	- Host-based Networks run on host computers.

# What is IDS & IPS

IDS: Intrustion Detection System is a device or software that monitors a network or system for policy violation.

IPS: Intrusion Detection and Prevention System, identify malicious activities, log them, report then try to block or stop it.
